Hello {full_name},

It has been a while since we’ve seen you on MOOC Conservation. Remember, the ongoing session finishes {course_end} so you should try to come back and finish the MOOC before. If you do not finish the course before this date you’ll have to retake all your exams.

If you don’t have time to make follow the MOOC at this point, there’s always next session.

See you again soon on mooc-conservation.org,
The MOOC Conservation team
