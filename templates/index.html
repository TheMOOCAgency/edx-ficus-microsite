          <p>The tropical zone is home to about half of the world's population. Much of this zone enjoys a relatively mild humid climate. Vernacular architectures were able to take advantage of the climate and local materials to produce comfortable buildings that meet the needs of the occupants.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this environmentally friendly approach has become quite rare in modern construction. The current underlying trend is rather towards a standardized, globalist and non-contextualized architecture, and an immoderate use of concrete, glass and metal. And finally, one frequently sees outdoor units of air conditioners covering the facades of many buildings.</p>
          <p>This 1st edition of the MOOC offers to reverse this t²rend by providing an <b>update of the bioclimatic principles relevant to the tropical humid zones</b>, giving a panoramic vision of the disciplines to be mastered for designing a sustainable building. This MOOC will be presented in English; some parts of the MOOC will, however, be accessible in local languages for participants from <b>Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam.</b></p>
          <p>A MOOC in French on the same topic has been presented by ADEME in the past, designed by Solener Consulting (and 6 experts) with the support of MOOC Unow Agency.</p>

          <h5>FORMAT AND ORGANIZATION OF TRAINING</h5>
          <p>The training is divided into <b>3 modules</b>. From 20th April 2021, and for three weeks, a new module opens every Tuesday to give rhythm to your learning. You will then have 3 additional weeks to complete the training, especially by engaging yourself in the proposed activities.</p>
          <p>In this MOOC, you will find course videos of short duration (about 5-6 minutes), case studies of exemplary buildings, testimonials, examples, and application exercises. There are only two slots to be blocked: these are the virtual classes where you
            will have the opportunity to have live discussion with your trainers, ask questions and clarify your doubts. The dates will be communicated to you when the MOOC is launched.</p>
          <p>The workload is estimated to be <b>2 to 3 hours</b> per week, but according to your interest and your availability, you may devote more time to go deeper into the subject by consulting the additional resources (reading materials, examples, quizzes, exercises…).</p>

          <h5>EVALUATION</h5>
          <p>At the end of each of the 3 weeks of the MOOC, the knowledge you have
          acquired will be assessed using questionnaires. These questionnaires will be
          graded. You will be able to view your results and assess to what extent you have
          learned from the MOOC, from the "Progress" area. The participants who can
          spare adequate time on “Additional Resources” will be able to better respond to
          the questionnaires.</p>
          <p>An activity, based on a real case of a building in a tropical zone, will also be
          shared with you so that you can put in practice what you learn from the videos.
          Though this exercise will not be graded, you will get opportunity to discuss the
          results with the trainers and fellow participants.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
          <h5>CERTIFICATE</h5>
          <p>At the end of the training, you will receive a certificate of successful participation if you complete the 3 evaluation questionnaires and obtain a minimum of 70% correct answers.</p>
          <p>This training certificate can allow you to highlight this MOOC on your CV / biodata.</p>
