Dear Participant,

I am very happy to welcome you to the HEC MBA Course Data for Managers.
This course has been originally developed as an Executive Short Certificate by the Netexplo Observatory and HEC, and it has been attended by almost 1000 managers in 2020.

It is composed of asynchronic lectures, testimonials, workshops and quiz, as well as two synchronic meetings over Zoom.
- a 1-hour Q/A meeting Wednesday, January 27 at 4:20 PM Paris time
- a 3-hour workshop: on Thursday, February 11 (9:00-12:10 PM Paris time) for half the cohort and Wednesday, February 17 (9:00-12:10 PM Paris time) for the other half.

You can already register at one of these two workshop sessions there: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10V9soz4Ln7YP8-1p_HrJsZJ6uOUG-BVJUOTWPQFB5Y4/edit?usp=sharing.

As you are 44, we will have 5 groups of 4 to 5 students for each of the two cohorts.
We have already registered you on the online platform, but there is a formal process to follow.
